Mandelbrot
==========

During one of my many Slashdot refreshes (circa 2001) I came across an article about the mandelbrot set. I was intrigued by how simple it was, and decided to make my own viewer.

That evening I wrote the program from 9pm to 2am in one sitting, so it’s really not that high quality or special. I tried to beef it up with some extra options but didn’t really get too far. All I had time to implement was:

* zoom in by drawing a box on the screen
* variable colors
* variable precision
* undo last view change
* reset the view to the beginning
* zoom out
* realign, in case you distort while zooming

That’s it. It’s actually pretty cool what kind of patterns you can find.
