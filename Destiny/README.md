Destiny
=======

Destiny was my leap from ASCII art to “real” graphics. I wrote this bad boy for a tenth-grade class assignment. Our task was to use a queue data structure any way we wanted. I wrote a bitmap library that used a queue to store picture data – probably the least appropriate way to use a queue or write a bitmap library.

At the time I had a very immature idea of how the VGA card worked and ended up brute-forcing most of the code. Also, it appears that whatever frame timing i used was optimized for the 486 computers we had in our lab; it’s too fast on new machines.

Despite my (relatively) impressive graphics, the gameplay was lacking. It was painfully obvious that Destiny would never be the crowd-pleaser that Albert Kuo’s circle-and-square Bomberman  clone was.

I attempted to expand the Destiny franchise with Destiny 2. I wrote smoother graphics code and the keyboard was more responsive. It never really got off the ground, and i was left with a fly-your-plane-through-empty-space game.
